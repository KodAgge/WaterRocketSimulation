This repository contains code for simulating the flight and maximal height of a water rocket described by the following equation systems:

![Equation system 1](/images/Eq1.png)

_equation system 1_

![Equation system 2](/images/Eq2.png)

_equation system 2_

## Results
The maximum height achieved was 73.3999 meters when the bottlenecks cross-sectional area was 1/3.594 of the bottle's body and the bottle was filled with 25.45% water.
